☯ Please note that the ![](http://i.cubeupload.com/GNjTGq.png) **Google Chrome** browser is recommended for using this extension, but it is supposed to work in any browser that has a userscript manager able to run [GM_* functions](http://tampermonkey.net/documentation.php#GM_addStyle).
 
**Happy New Year!**
Did you ever feel like Scratch needed more blocks? I certainly do, and I think you probably feel like this too.
For this reason, I present you... TGB'S Extensions!

**Features**

This Scratch Extension brings **over a 100 new features** to Scratch, from string manipulation to blocks that evaluate Math [(works a lot like it does in this web app)](http://mathnotepad.com/). There are so many possibilities!

Then out of the blue someone appears and asks:
**"** But TGB, we can't even share projects that use extensions properly! It's such a long and boring process! **"**
Fear not, Scratcher! Projects that use TGB's Extension can be shared just like a common project, you just have to share it through the Project's page!
